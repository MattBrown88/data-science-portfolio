## Data Science Competitions

### Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table - Hosted by DrivenData.org

Competition Description: Can you predict which water pumps are faulty? Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, can you predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all? 

I used an ensemble of XGBoost models to predict the functionality of the water pumps
